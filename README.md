# Snake-Robot

The robot is based on wheels to model the anisotropic friction with the ground.
I added a control algorithm to make the snake go through waypoints.

You can run the simulation, and then run the snake path analysis script to analyse the path of the snake and the behavior of the controller. 

You can modify the waypoints to change the path of the snake. 
However, the path must be as smooth as possible for better performances.
 ==> Consecutives waypoints must not have an angle > 90Â°
