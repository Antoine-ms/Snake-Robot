# Snake-Robot

This 4th version is based on wheels to model the anisotropic friction with the ground.
I added a control algorithm to make the snake go through waypoints.
One last problem is the discontinuity at pi / -pi that I am struggling to patch.

You can run the simulation, and then run the snake path analysis script to analyse the path of the snake and the behavior of the controller.
