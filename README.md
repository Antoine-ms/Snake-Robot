# Snake-Robot

Execute the script first in order to set all the model parameters.


The 1st model (Snake_Robot_v1) is based on anisotropic friction. The snake body moves as it should but the robot is not moving forward. It is probably coming from the friction parameters but I coulnd't make it work yet. 

The 2nd model (Snake_Robot_v2_wheels_test) is based on small wheels in order to replace the anisotropic friction model. The goal was to confirm that the issue on the 1st model was the friction. This model works very well but it is incredibly slow to compute.
